This project aims to encourage sustainable consumption habits in communities by focusing on breakfast cereals and beverages. Through three key phases—Engage, Educate, and Transform—it plans to raise awareness about sustainability, inspire behavior change, and promote healthier choices.

### **Phase 1: Engage - Understanding Community Needs (Months 1-2)**
In this phase, the goal is to understand what people currently think and do when it comes to choosing breakfast cereals and beverages. By working closely with community members like local authorities, consumers, and schools, the project team will:
- **Run Focus Groups**: Talk directly with community members to learn their opinions, challenges, and motivators regarding sustainable food choices.
- **Observe Real-Life Choices**: Study how people choose and dispose of food items to get a realistic view of behaviors.
- **Map Data**: Collect and analyze various sources of information (from direct surveys to published studies) to understand consumption patterns and potential sustainable alternatives.
- **Digital Storytelling Workshop**: Host an interactive workshop where local artists and community members create art that tells a story about sustainability, setting the stage for a digital awareness campaign.

**Goal for Phase 1**: Gather a deep understanding of the community’s attitudes, barriers, and ideas for sustainable food choices.

### **Phase 2: Educate - Launching a Digital Awareness Campaign (Months 2-3)**
This phase is about educating the community through a fun, creative, and engaging competition that encourages sustainable behavior:
- **Digital Food Mosaic Competition**: An online competition where participants create a "digital food mosaic" that represents their commitment to sustainable breakfast choices.
- **Gamified Learning**: Participants earn points and badges by completing educational activities on sustainable practices, making it enjoyable and rewarding to learn about sustainability.
- **Incorporating Art**: The competition lets people express their connections to food and sustainability through creative digital art.
- **Local Rewards**: By partnering with local food producers, the project will link online rewards to real-world benefits like discounts on sustainable products.

**Goal for Phase 2**: Educate the community about sustainability and motivate them to make sustainable food choices through a fun and interactive platform.

### **Phase 3: Transform - Creating Long-Term Change (Month 4)**
In this final phase, the project aims to sustain the impact of previous phases by:
- **Celebrating with a Digital Launch Event**: Hosting an online event to showcase the completed digital "food mosaic," which includes the stories and pledges made by community members.
- **Advocating for Policy Changes**: Collaborate with local authorities, schools, and consumer groups to promote policies that support sustainable practices, like reusable containers for cereals and beverages.
- **Open-Access Repository**: Make all the project resources (research, art, learning materials) freely accessible so that other communities can replicate the model to encourage sustainable food systems.

**Goal for Phase 3**: Ensure long-term sustainability by embedding the project’s ideas into community practices and advocating for policy support.

### **Measuring Success and Impact**
The project will track its success through key performance indicators (KPIs) across three areas:
- **Social Impact**: Tracking community engagement (e.g., participation in the competition, points earned) and partnerships with local food producers.
- **Environmental Impact**: Measuring reductions in single-use plastic and food miles (distance food travels before consumption).
- **Health Impact**: Observing changes in community choices toward healthier breakfast options.

### **Project Motive**
The primary aim of this project is to empower communities to make sustainable, healthier choices with breakfast cereals and beverages. By combining education, creativity, and real-world rewards, it aims to foster long-term change that reduces waste, supports local businesses, and promotes nutritious food options. This project also serves as a model that other communities can adopt, ultimately supporting a broader transition to sustainable food systems.
